# What is this?

This is my blog [willhopkinsphoto.xyz](https://willhopkinsphoto.xyz). It's hosted by Cloudflare Pages, using Hugo as the engine.

# How to set one up for yourself

Check out my code here, and Cloudflare Pages has a [pretty good intro](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site).

That said, Hugo isn't as easy to grok as I'd like for new users and non-developers, so I'll make a tutorial based on what I've learned so far at some point.

# Notes & Reminders

## Linking images

GitHub parses paths like /static/img/path_to_photo.jpg just fine. Cloudflare doesn't.

Make sure to link as /img/path_to_photo.jpg.

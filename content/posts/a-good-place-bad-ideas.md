# Quitting social media

A few weeks ago, a petty tyrant mod on reddit got under my skin. I decided to take the rest of August off of social media and... I didn't regret it?

My brain has had more space in it the last while. I don't have the same automatic responses to being bored. I killed my Twitter account, am about to kill my reddit account, and Instagram is relegated to the mobile webpage.[1]

It's felt so good that I want to keep it this way. Everyone and their mother has been saying to blog or write a newsletter instead of social media, so I'm jumping on the bandwagon.

# A good place...

I hope to blog semi-regularly on a schedule I haven't settled on yet. My topics will be chosen as I take photos and learn about taking photos. That will mean some process posts, sharing projects and results, and talking about the philosophy and art guiding my work.

# To have bad ideas

I also intend to share mistakes, rough ideas, works in progress, and other ephemera. It's my space, and I'll run it how I please.

If you want to see my polished work, first of all thank you! [Check out my portfolio](http://willhopkinsphoto.com). This blog is very much not that.

# Going forward

Who knows, this may not work out for me. I'm not making any promises just yet. But I'm going to give it a real try.

The benefit of the silence in the wake of social media has been thought. I've thought, a lot. Sometimes it hurt *yuk yuk*. And I want to continue to develop those thoughts about the artistic work of myself and others, so I need a place to do that.

Here's to new beginnings.
